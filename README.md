Mambo Initial Launch Offering - enabling probably the most fair token launches possible

https://mambo.li/milo

MILO is Mambo Initial Launch Offering.
Probably one of the most fair initial token offering possible.
based on MamboSwap technology with it's possibility to limit daily swap amount per account and with fixed rates.
Togehter this enables a launch where the majority of small investores get their aimed share in full - 
since bigger investores can only buy with bigger amounts later, when the daily limits are lifted up.

It will be a decicated for ILO's clone of MamboSwap, running on it's own page.
In development. 
Planned first MILO event is the launch of MILK, Baby Stable, a growing stablecoin, to be bought at launch with $Mambos.
And once launched it will be tradeable at fixed rates at Mamboswap vs FRANC and of course zilswap.

First MILO event planned for August 2021.

If you are interested to issue a token with MILO, contact admin of telegram group: MamboToken
You can launch a new token at a fixed price vs FRANC Chocolate Stablecoin (or another of our stablecoins).
